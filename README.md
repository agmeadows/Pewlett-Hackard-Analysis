 Depeding on the amount of time it takes to train and the number of people who enter the mentorship program, it may be impossible to train enough people in time. Also, it should be noted that no managers are eligibile for the mentioship program.

 ## Conclusion

 HP is not fully prepared for the "silver tsunami". They either need to adjust thier criteria for employees who can enter the mentioship program or hire seasoned professionals who can fill the outgoing employees.
